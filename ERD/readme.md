# DataScape: Mastering Database Design

## About the Project
This project is part of the comprehensive **ALX Airbnb Database Module**, focusing on database design, normalization, schema creation, and seeding. By working through these tasks, learners will design and build a robust relational database for an Airbnb-like application, ensuring scalability, efficiency, and real-world functionality. The project simulates a production-level database system, emphasizing high standards of design, development, and data handling.

## Learning Objectives
As a professional developer, completing these tasks will empower you to:

- Apply advanced principles of **database design** to model complex systems.
- Master the art of **normalization** to optimize database efficiency and minimize redundancy.
- Use **SQL DDL** to define database schema with appropriate constraints, keys, and indexing for performance optimization.
- Write and execute **SQL DML** scripts to seed databases with realistic sample data, simulating real-world scenarios.
- Enhance collaboration skills by managing repositories, documenting processes, and adhering to professional submission standards.

## Requirements
To successfully complete these tasks, you must:

1. Have a strong foundation in **relational databases** and SQL.
2. Be proficient in using **Draw.io** or similar tools for visual modeling.
3. Possess a good understanding of **data normalization principles**, particularly up to **3NF**.
4. Have experience with GitHub repositories for documentation and project submission.
5. Follow industry best practices for database design and scripting.

## Key Highlights
- **Task 1**: Craft a detailed **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to visualize the database design, ensuring clear relationships and properly defined entities.
- **Task 2:** Apply **normalization principles** to refine your database design, optimizing data integrity and minimizing redundancy.
- **Task 3:** Create SQL scripts to define the database schema, incorporating primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes for optimal query performance.
- **Task 4:** Populate the database with **real-world sample data**, simulating an Airbnb-like environment with users, properties, bookings, and payments.

Each task builds on the previous one, providing a step-by-step approach to developing a robust database system. By completing this project, you’ll gain hands-on experience with real-world database challenges, preparing you for complex projects in professional environments.

# Tasks
## Task 0. **Define Entities and Relationships in ER Diagram**

**Objective:** Create an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram based on the database specification [here]().

## Instructions:

- Identify all entities (User, Property, Booking, etc.) and their attributes.

- Define the relationships between entities (e.g., User to Booking, Property to Booking).

- Use *Draw.io* or another tool to create a visual representation of your ER diagram.

## Repo:

- GitHub repository: alx-airbnb-database

## Task 1. Normalize Your Database Design

**Objective:** Apply normalization principles to ensure the database is in the third normal form (3NF).

## Instructions:

- Review your schema and identify any potential redundancies or violations of normalization principles.

- Adjust your database design to achieve 3NF, if necessary.

- Provide an explanation of your normalization steps in a Markdown file.

## Repo:

- GitHub repository: alx-airbnb-database
- File: normalization.md

## Task 2. Design Database Schema (DDL)

**Objective:** Write SQL queries to define the database schema (create tables, set constraints).

## Instructions:

- Based on the provided database specification, create SQL CREATE TABLE statements for each entity.

- Ensure proper data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

- Create necessary indexes on columns for optimal performance.

## Repo:

- GitHub repository: alx-airbnb-database
- Directory: database-script-0x01
File: schema.sql, README.md

## Task 3. Seed the Database with Sample Data

**Objective:** Create SQL scripts to populate the database with sample data.

## Instructions:

- Write SQL INSERT statements to add sample data for User, Property, Booking, etc.

- Ensure the sample data reflects real-world usage (e.g., multiple users, bookings, payments).

## Repo:

- GitHub repository: alx-airbnb-database
- Directory: database-script-0x02
- File: seed.sql, README.md

## Task 4. Manual Review
